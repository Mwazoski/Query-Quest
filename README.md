<p align="center">Query-Quest is a cool open-source project that's all about making learning SQL fun and effective for database students at different universities. Every university gets to tweak their own Query-Quest app to fit what their students need. It's like giving students their own SQL playground to experiment, make mistakes, and get better, all while keeping things interesting and relevant to what they'll face in the real world.
