# Contributing to Query Quest

Thank you for considering contributing to **Query Quest**! We welcome contributions from everyone. By participating, you are expected to uphold the following guidelines, which help ensure that our community remains welcoming, inclusive, and productive.

## 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Query-Quest.git
   ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote**: Set the upstream remote to sync changes from the main repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Mwazoski/Query-Quest.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```

## 2. Creating an Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before opening a new issue, check if the issue already exists in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Mwazoski/Query-Quest/issues). If an existing issue matches your report, please comment on that issue instead of creating a new one.
2. **New Issues**: If your issue hasn’t been reported yet, open a new issue. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem, expected behavior, and any relevant error messages.

## 3. Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch to make your changes:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name
   ```

2. **Write Tests**: Ensure that your changes are well-tested. If you add new functionality, please include corresponding tests.

3. **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project. Ensure your code is properly formatted and linted.

4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. A good format is:
   ```
   Subject line (short, imperative): Fixed issue with query execution

   Detailed explanation of the commit. Mention relevant issues using GitHub keywords (Fixes #issue-number).
   ```
5. **Keep Commits Small**: Try to keep commits focused on a single change. This makes it easier to review your work.

## 4. Submitting Changes

1. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-or-bugfix-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and [open a pull request](https://github.com/Mwazoski/Query-Quest/pulls). In your PR description:
   - Reference any related issues.
   - Describe the changes you made and why.
   - Link to any relevant documentation or screenshots.
3. **Review Process**: A project maintainer will review your pull request. You may be asked to make changes or clarify parts of your code. Please be responsive to feedback.
