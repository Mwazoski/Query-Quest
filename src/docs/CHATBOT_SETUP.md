# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# Chat Configuration
CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT=Your custom system prompt here...
```

### 2. Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env.local` file

### 3. Customize the System Prompt

You are Query Quest Assistant, an AI assistant for a SQL learning platform called Query Quest.

Your role is to help users with:
- SQL query writing and optimization
- Database concepts and theory
- Understanding SQL challenges and exercises
- Platform features and navigation
- Learning SQL best practices
- Debugging SQL problems

Be helpful, patient, and encouraging. Explain concepts clearly and provide examples when helpful. If a user asks about something outside of SQL/database topics, gently redirect them back to SQL learning topics.

Always maintain a supportive and educational tone.

```

### Adjusting Response Length
```env
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1500  # For longer, more detailed responses
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=500   # For shorter, concise responses
```

### Fine-tuning Temperature
```env
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.3  # More focused, consistent responses

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key not configured"**
- Check your `.env.local` file
- Ensure the API key is valid
- Restart your development server

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- OpenAI has usage limits based on your plan
